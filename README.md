# Dashboard
Was task with creating a CRUD module that uses MongoDB and then create an interactive dashboard that shows the information.

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

1) Encapsulation plays a part a large in createing  a program that is maintainable, readable and adaptable. This is especially true for programs that uses functions multiple time. For this project I created a CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete) Python module to intearct with a database. The advantage of this is didn't have to repeately write the same code in order for me to read and make changes to the database. Instead I only had to call the functions with the information I wanted to create, read, update or delete. Another advantage is that this module can be adapted to any future program that use the MongoDB.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

2) I appraoch a problem as a computer scientist by first considering the clients needs. How can a create this program that does everything the client wants it to do, as well as being easy for them to use and maintain after I've finshed. The main diffrent between this project and previous assignments is the client/server aspect of the project. Createing a code that had to be able to interact with a database. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

3) Computer Scientists create applications useing code to make life easier for thier clients, customers and everyone who will use their code. It matters because, in a way, we help further the success of  indiviuals and companies. The code we create for them will allow them to concentrate on more important matters, while the system preform what every task they wanted it to do. For this project, Grazioso Salvare has system on hand, that when a disater strike and people need rescueing. With a few click of a buttons, they can find active and avalibe rescue dogs to send out into the feild. This provide a greater chance for people in need to be found and rescued.
